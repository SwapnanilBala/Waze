# 🚗 **Waze Churn Prediction Project**

> *"Turning data into insight — predicting which users are most likely to hit the brakes and churn!"*

---

### 🎯 **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to **build a Machine Learning model** that can  
💡 **predict which users are most likely to churn**,  
and more importantly, **find actionable insights to keep them engaged**.

> 🧩 For those unfamiliar with the term **churn** — it refers to how likely a user is to **stop using a service** or **leave the platform**.

### 🧠 **Environment Recommendation**

> ⚙️ This project is best explored in **Jupyter Notebook**  
*(for better visualization, step-by-step analysis, and clean inline plots!)*

### 🧾 **Project Structure**

Please go through the files **step-by-step** 👇

1. 📁 **Preliminary Analysis**  
   - Contains initial exploration, dataset overview, and structure inspection.

2. 🔍 **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Visual insights, correlation maps, missing data handling, and outlier detection.

3. 🧪 **Data Exploration & Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Testing assumptions, statistical tests (t-test, chi-square, ANOVA), and validation.

4. 📉 **Regression Analysis**  
   - Building baseline models and analyzing relationships between predictors.

5. 🤖 **Machine Learning Model Building**  
   - Training and tuning models to predict churn with high accuracy.
