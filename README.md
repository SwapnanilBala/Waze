# Waze
The goal of this project is to `build a machine learning model to predict which user is most likely to churn` and therefore `finding ways to make them stay`. 
now for those who aren't familiar withe the word `churn`, it means that (how much is a user likely to refrain or leave from using a service).

### Jupyter notebook is recommended.

Please note that (Go through one by one)

1. `The Preliminary analysis and the details regarding it are in the root files.`

2. `EDA`

3. `Data Exploraion and Hypothesis Testing`

4. `Regrssion Analysis`

5. `Building a Machine Learning Model`

Used packages 
- pandas, numpy,  matplotlib.pyplot
- datetime, seaborn, stats from scipy
-  from sklearn, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
-  train_test_split,  classification_report,  metrics eg. accuracy_score recall_score, f1_score,
-  confusion_matrix,
-  LogisticRegression,
-  GridSearchCV,
-  RandomForestClassifier,
-  XGBClassifier,
-  from xgboost plot_import importance etc.
